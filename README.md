# CIS7Project
Author(s): Annabelle Tamano
Project Description:
This projectâ€™s central focus is to solve Case 2 (UCR Medical Center Volunteers). Every year, 100 graduates from UCR are selected to participate in the Doctors Without Borders program in collaboration with the UCR Medical Center. The selection process involves factors such as language fluency and medical specialty to match graduates with physicians in countries that they are best suited to perform in. The objective of this case is to essentially simulate and display the probability of a graduate student being matched with a doctor from a specific country in the Doctors Without Borders program based on language fluency and medical specialty.
